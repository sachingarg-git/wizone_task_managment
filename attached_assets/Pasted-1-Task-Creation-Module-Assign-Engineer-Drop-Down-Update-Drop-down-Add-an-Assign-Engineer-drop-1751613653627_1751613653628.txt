1. Task Creation Module - Assign Engineer Drop-Down
Update Drop-down:

Add an “Assign Engineer” drop-down in the task creation module.

The drop-down should fetch the list of available engineers dynamically from your users database.

Include an “Add New Engineer” option at the end of the list for quick addition (optional but useful).

Across App Consistency:

Ensure this improved drop-down (with “Add Option” if applicable) is used throughout the app wherever engineer or user selection is required for consistency.

2. Roles Section - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role Creation:

Add a Roles Management section under Admin/Settings.

Allow creation of new roles (e.g., Admin, Engineer, Manager, Viewer).

Permissions:

Each role should have granular permissions for Create, Edit, Delete, and View for each module (Task, User, Project, etc.).

Use toggles or checkboxes for easy permission assignment.

Assign Roles to Users:

During or after user creation, assign a specific role to each user.

Roles should be editable later by admins only.

3. Add User - Form Style
User Addition Form:

Use a clean modal or dedicated page with clear sections:

Name, Email, Mobile, Role (drop-down), Department, Password, Status (Active/Inactive), etc.

Use drop-downs where relevant (like Role selection).

Add validation (required fields, email format, password rules).

Include a “Save & Add Another” button for quick onboarding.

Consistent Styling:

Follow the same input field style and button placement throughout the app.
